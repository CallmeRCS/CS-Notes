#### Always keep this 3 concepts in mind

1. The Incident Response plan responds to unexpected changes in operating conditions to keep the business operating.
2. The Business Continuity plan enables the business to continue operating throughout the crisis.
3. If both the Incident Response and Business Continuity plans fail, the Disaster Recovery plan is activated to help the business return to normal operations as quickly as possible.
#### [[Incident terminology]]
#### The goal of  incident response
Now the you know about types of events and incidents is time to understand the main goal of incident response. 
>The priority of any incident response is to protect ==life, health, and safety==. When any decision related to priorities is to be made, always choose safety first. Some industries use the term "crisis management" to describe the incident management process.
#### [[Components of the Incident Response Plan]]
#### [[Incident Response Team]]

==Every organization must have an incident response plan that will help preserve business viability and survival==. Incident response planning is a subset of the greater discipline of business continuity management (BCM). ==Most of the time, Business continuity includes planning, preparation response and recovery operations== but it does not generally include activities to support full restoration of all business activities and services. [[Let's talk more about the importance of Business Continuity]].

#### What is the "red book"?
Some organizations have what is called the red book, which is given to the appropriate individual outside the facility. All the procedures are outlined in that document in case an incident take place in the company which is compromised and there is no access to electronic backups. It is important to update any time the electronic copy is updated. So both versions remain consistent.
#### The goal of disaster recovery
When a disaster strikes or an interruption of business activities occurs, the **disaster recovery plan (DRP)** guides the actions of emergency response personnel until the end goal is reached, which is to see the business restored to full last-known reliable operations. Part of the workflow of the disaster recovery refers specifically to restoring the information technology and communications services and systems needed by an organization, both during the period of disruption caused by any event. And during restoration of normal services.
>Disaster recovery planning steps in where business continuity (BC) leaves off.

 Data backups are essential for disaster recovery, ensuring swift restoration of critical information post-disaster, mitigating risks, and maintaining operational continuity. It is necessary to consider the database and dependencies on other systems to address the intricate dependencies of complex systems, ensuring a successful disaster recovery plan.
 
**"Whereas ==business continuity planning== is about maintaining critical business functions, ==disaster recovery planning== is about restoring IT and communications back to full operation operations after a disruption"**
