#### The CIA Triad it stands for:

- [[Confidentiality]]
- [[Integrity]]
- [[Availability]]

>The base idea of this triad of terms it is that everyone can easily understand terms of security. To have a better concept of what is and define its purpose.

### Privacy

Is the right of an individual to control the distribution of information about themselves.
>In 2016, the European Union passed comprehensive legislation that addresses personal privacy, deeming it an individual human right.

A excellent example of laws and regulations within countries is the "==General Data Protection Regulation==" or the GDPR. This is a law with multinational implications around the European Union. Which applies to all organizations, foreign or domestic, doing business in the EU or any person in the EU.

Another example is HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability), in the United States, HIPAA controls how the privacy of medical information must be maintained.
### Introduction to Risk Management

![[Pasted image 20240729171500.png]]

Risk management is meant to decide and understand much of the possible risk envolved cybersecurity. It's all about the risk the entity or company is willing to accept, knowing that we go forward to apply such cybersecurity changes to decrease or stabilize the possible risks, that's will be the potential consequences on what is going on on our environment. 

Risk can come from: 
1. Cyberattacks such as malware, social engineering or denial of service attacks.
2. It could be more physical such as fire, violente crime or natural disaster. 
##### [[Let's talk about Risk Management Terminology]]
##### [[Decision making based on risk priorities]]
##### [[Risk Identification]]
##### [[Risk Treatment]]
##### [[Risk Tolerance]]
##### [[Risk Assessment]]
### Threats, Vulnerabilities and Likelihood

These 3 words would likely to hear more than often, their meaning in general are co-related between them. When having a threat into you or someone, most potential reason could be you or they are likelihood to be vulnerables to the thread. It is like when getting to a place with a massive crowd, if you aren't aware of stuff like this and be a naÃ¯ve person, well it most likely that you could be a possible pickpocket victim, and all of this because you didn't be aware of all of this. Another type of triad. We could call it =="The victim triad"==.  
>The Victim Triad consist of getting a thread because you probably have a higher likelihood to be in danger cause your vulnerabilities in the situation.
##### Now let's take some vocabulary in our mind

- Threats actor: It is the user that is making the threat around a population
- Threats vector: Are the tools, approaches and technique to make it happen, the damage.
### What is PII?

PII stands for ==Personally Identifiable Information==, it is used to describe information that, when combined with other pieces of data, significantly narrows the possibility of association with more individuals.

### Standards

Standards cover a broad range of issues and ideas. Here are some example of organizations that have created widely used standards

- ISO => International Organization for Standardization
- NIST => National Institute of Standards and Technology
- IETF => Internet Engineering Task Force
### About the code of ethics

Code of ethic, ==which states that information security professionals must act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly and legally==.
### Authentication

Not only confidentiality among the information of the people is important, identifying the identity of the user is completely necessary, that's authentication in simple terms, because we need to validate that they are the rightful owners of that identity. [[Here you can see 3 common methods of authentication]].
### Let's talk about Governance Elements

The main concept is to understand, company in their own working areas, have goals and duties that they want to achieved. To complete the objective requires:

1. That decisions are made it.
2. Rules and practices are defined
3. Policies and procedures are in place to guide the organization in its pursuit of achieving its goals and mission.
##### Remember this...

>When leaders and management implement the systems and structures that the organization will use to achieve its goals, they are guided by laws and regulations created by governments to enact public policy. Laws and regulations guide the development of standards, which cultivate policies, which result in procedures.

Let's use this diagram in order to understand better all the governance element, but we are going backwards to explain from the inside.

![[Pasted image 20240731054308.png]]

1. Procedures are the detailed steps to complete a task that support departmental or organizational policies.
2. Policies are put in place by organizational governance, such as executive management, to provide guidance in all activities to ensure that the organization support industry standards and regulations
3. Standards are often used by governance teams to provide a framework to introduce policies and procedures in support of the regulations.
4. Regulations are commonly issued in the form of laws, usually from the government (not to be confused with governance) and typically carry financial penalties for non-compliance.
### What is "Non-repudiation"

Is a legal term defined as the protection against an individual falsely denying having performed a particular action. It provides the capability to determine whether a given individual took a particular action, such as created information, approved information or sent a received a message.

>Non-repudiation methodologies ensure that people are held responsible for transactions they conducted.
### What are security controls?

Security controls pertain to the physical, technical, and administrative mechanisms that act as safeguard or countermeasures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. The implementation of controls should reduce risk to tan acceptable level.

2. [[Administrative controls]]
