The concept of an intrusion occurs when and attacker is able to bypass or thwart security mechanism and gain access to an organization's resources. ==Intrusion detection== **is a specific form of monitoring that monitors recorded information and real-time events to detect abnormal activity indicating a potential incident or intrusion**. ==Intrusion Detection Systems== automates the inspection of logs an real-time system events to detect intrusion attempts and system failures. ==We have 2 types of IDS==.
>An important fact is that those systems can be part of a defense-in-depth security as a complement but mechanisms such as firewalls never will be replace.
### Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)

- Monitors activity on a single computer, including process call and information recorded in system, applications, security and host-based firewalls logs.
- It can be more event-examing specific than a NIDS and HIDS can detect anomalies on the host system that NIDS can detect.
- It can also tracks processes employed by the attacker.
### Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

- Monitors and evaluates network activity to detect attacks or events anomalies. It can't monitor encrypted packages traffic but can monitor other details.
- It uses remote sensor to monitor the entire network to collect data at key network locations that send data to a central management console.
>Sensor could track traffic at routers, firewalls, network switches that support port mirroring, and other types of network taps.

- It don't affect a lot the performance of the network.
- Usually able to detect the initiation of an attack or ongoing attacks but they can't always provide information about the success of an attack. It don't know if affect something as specific to the systems, user accounts, files, or applications.
