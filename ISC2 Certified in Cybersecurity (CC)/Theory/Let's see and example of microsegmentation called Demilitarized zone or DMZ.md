Is a common practice in security architecture, with a DMZ, host systems that are accessible through the firewall are physically separated from the internal network by means of secured switches or by using an additional firewall to control traffic between the web server and the internal network. Application DMZs (or semi-trusted networks) are frequently used today  to limit access to application servers to those networks or systems that have a legitimate need to connect.
>Demilitarized Zones (DMZ) are a portion of the network which interfaces directly with the outside world and has more security controls and restrictions than its wider IT environment.
#### What is a Web-Application Firewall (WAF)?

The WAF has an internal and an external connection like a traditional firewall, with the external traffic being filtered by the traditional or next generation firewall first. It monitors all traffic, encrypted or not from the outside for malicious behavior before passing commands to a web server that may be internal to the network.
