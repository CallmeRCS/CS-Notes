Is a specific type of access control policy that is enforced over all subjects and objects in an information system. 

Some of the actions that this type of policy grant us:

- Pass the information to other subjects or objects.
- Grant its privileges to other subjects.
- Change security attributes on subjects, objects, information systems or system components.
- Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects.
- Change the rules governing access control; mandatory access controls restrict this capability.

DACs are not very scalable; they rely on the access control decisions made by each individual object owner, and it can be difficult to find the source of access control issues when problems occur. 

Most information systems are DAC systems. In a DAC system, a user who has access to a file is able to share that file with or pass it to someone else. It is at the discretion of the asset owner whether to grant or revoke access for a user.
