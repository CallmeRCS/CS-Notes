RBAC provides each worker privileges based on what  role they have in the organization. Some examples could be:
- Only HR has access to personnel files.
- Only Finance has access to bank accounts.
- Each manager has access to their own direct reports and their own department.
- Very high level system admins may have access to everything.
- New employees would have very limited access, the minimum required to do their jobs.
>When talking about privilege creep or permissions creep; let's say a junior worker's permissions might be expanded so they can temporarily act as the department manager but their permissions aren't changed back when the new manager is hired, then the next person to come in at that junior level might inherit those permissions when it is not appropriate for them to have them.

One good practice when hiring or changing roles, is to not copy user profiles to new users. It is recommended that standard roles are established, and new users are created based on those standards rather than an actual user. That way, new employees start with the appropriate roles and permissions. But know, let's talk in more depth about those who have more [[Privileged accounts]] and how they manage to maintain secure.
