 **Is a special type of active IDS that automatically attempts to detect and block attacks before they reach target systems**

- An important difference between and IDS and IPS is that the IPS **==is placed in line with the traffic==**. It is common to see the IPS function integrated into firewalls. Just like IDS, there are Network-based IPS (NIPS) and Host-based IPS (HIPS)
