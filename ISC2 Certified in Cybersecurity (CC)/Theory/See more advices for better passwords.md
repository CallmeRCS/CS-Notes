Let's see this case scenario first before entering to the main concept of the text:
>If you have 10 number password, then with software with the cryptographic calculation to brute force attack your environment, it will take 5 seconds to crack. 

Most people think 8 characters with multiple different characters is pretty secure and that's kink of standard for password requirements. But if someone really wants it, it may take them 35 days... we rather be more secure than that. Let's see other password scenarios to contemplate:

Having a 16 characters with one upper case and one special character, this is more secure because you have upper and lower case characters and special characters, to crack this, will take about:
152 000 years.

In resume, just by following a good password policy and appropriate procedures, we can improve our password security immensely.
