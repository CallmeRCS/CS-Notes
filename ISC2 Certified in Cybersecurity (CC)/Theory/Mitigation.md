Is the most common type of risk management and includes taking actions to prevent or reduce the possibility of a risk event or its impact. Mitigation can involve remediation measures such as security controls, policies, procedures, and standards to minimize adverse risk. Risk cannot always be mitigated, but mitigations such as safety measures should always be in place.

Example:

A hospital identifies the risk of a **ransomware attack** targeting its patient record system.  
To reduce the likelihood and impact, the hospital implements multiple controls:

- Regular **data backups** stored offline.
- **Network segmentation** to isolate critical systems.
- **Endpoint detection and response (EDR)** to detect malicious activity early.  
>These measures do not eliminate the risk, but they **significantly mitigate** its potential impact.
