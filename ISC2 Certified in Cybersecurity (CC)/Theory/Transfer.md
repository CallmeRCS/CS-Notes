Is the practice of passing the risk to another party who will accept, the financial impart of the harm resulting from a risk being realized in exchange for payment. Typically, this is an insurance policy.

Example:

A company identifies the **financial impact of a ransomware attack** as a risk, which could include ransom payments, recovery costs, and potential lawsuits.  
Instead of bearing the entire impact or trying to eliminate it completely (which is very difficult), the company decides to **purchase a cyber insurance policy** that covers:

- Incident response costs
- Data recovery expenses    
- Business interruption losses    
- Potential legal or regulatory penalties    

In this way, the company **transfers the financial risk** to the insurance provider. The risk does not disappear, but the **economic impact** is largely absorbed by the insurer.
