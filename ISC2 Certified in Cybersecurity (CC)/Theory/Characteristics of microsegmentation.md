- The first we need to understand is the possibility of granular restriction. Saying this, apply to create specific permissions to the network devices for example a individual machine or users. For instance, it can limit which IP addresses can communicate to a given machine, at which time of day, with which credentials, and which services those connections can use.

- Now, microsegmentation is completely logical not physical, the administrator can apply rules to various machines without needing some extra wired connections in the network environment.

- Microsegmentation is the ultimate end state of the defense-in-depth philosophy; no single point of access within the IT environment can lead to broader compromise.

- Microsegmentation is necessary in cloud environments cause of the sharing process that is happening along the way where more than one customer's data and functionality might reside on the same device(s) and where third party personnel might have physical access to the devices.

- Microsegmentation allows to enforce the concept of least privileges, where each department of the company just have the necessaries roles and permission to completely their daily job. And applying this concept we will reduce the risk of exposure.

- In modern environments, microsegmentation is available because of virtualization and software-defined networking (SDN) technologies. In the strategy are often called "virtual private networks (VPN)" or "Security Groups".
>A Virtual Private Network is not necessarily an encrypted tunnel. It is simply a point-to-point connection between two hosts that allows them to communicate. Organizations use gateway-to-gateway VPNs as an alternative to expensive dedicated point-to-point connections. 

- Even in your home, microsegmentation can be used to separate computers from smart TVs, air conditioning, and smart appliances, which can be connected and have vulnerabilities.
