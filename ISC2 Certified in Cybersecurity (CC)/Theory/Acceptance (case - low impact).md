Is taking no action to reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring. Management may opt to conduct the business function associated with the risk without any further action on the part of the organization, either because the impact or likelihood of occurrence is negligible or because the benefit is more than enough to offset that risk.

Example:

An organization identifies that some employees might **reuse weak passwords** despite awareness training. The probability of this risk is considered **low**, and the potential impact is **limited**, since sensitive systems already require multi-factor authentication (MFA). The company decides to **accept the risk**, acknowledging that the cost of additional controls outweighs the potential damage.
