Is defined as the process of ==identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks== to an organization's operations (including its mission, function, image, and reputation), assets, individuals, other organizations, and even the nation.

The result of the risk assessment process is often documented as a report or presentation given to management for their use in prioritizing the identified risk(s). This report is provided to management for review and approval.

> Risk assessment should result in aligning (or associating) each identified risk resulting from the operation of an information system with the goals, objectives, assets or processes that the organization uses, which in turn aligns with or directly supports the organization's goals and objectives.
