1. **SYN Flood** – Exploits the TCP handshake by sending many SYN requests without completing the connection.
2. **ICMP Flood (Ping Flood)** – Overloads the target with ICMP echo requests.
3. **Smurf Attack** – Uses ICMP requests with a spoofed IP, amplifying traffic to the victim.
4. **UDP Flood** – Bombards random ports with UDP packets, forcing the system to respond with ICMP “unreachable.”
5. **Ping of Death** – Sends oversized/malformed packets to crash systems.
6. **Application Layer DoS** – Overloads specific services (e.g., HTTP GET/POST flood against web servers).
7. **Distributed DoS (DDoS)** – DoS executed simultaneously by multiple compromised systems (botnets).
